### Advantages of Using AI:  
1. AI helped me quickly generate foundational code for implementing classes and methods.  
2. AI could rapidly write test classes based on my requirements. For instance, if I wanted to test whether a method
behaved as expected, AI could directly generate the test code for me.
3. AI assisted in refining my game concept. Initially, I had a vague idea with no clear goal, but I could share my
scattered inspirations with AI, and it eventually helped me consolidate them into a complete concept.

### Disadvantages of Using AI:  
1. Some of the generated code did not align with the specific project requirements and required substantial
modifications.
2. AI occasionally misunderstood my questions.  
3. Debugging became challenging when AI's suggestions led to unexpected issues in the game logic.  
4. AI performed poorly in bug fixing. The modifications it made often introduced even more bugs.  

### Summary and Suggestions:  
Overall, using AI significantly reduced the time I spent on repetitive tasks and provided creative ideas for game
development. However, I found that AI's suggestions sometimes needed further refinement to meet specific project
requirements. If I were to use AI for similar projects in the future, I would spend more time formulating precise
prompts to minimize miscommunication and would prefer to fix bugs myself whenever possible.
