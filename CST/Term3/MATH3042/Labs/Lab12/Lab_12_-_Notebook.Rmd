```{R setup, include=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
data(survey)
```

### Question 1
```{R}
cor(X, Y, use="complete.obs")

cor.test(survey$Age, survey$Height, alternative = "two.sided")
```
**Conclusion: There is no evidence for correlation between Age and Height at the population level(p-value = 0.5921)**
